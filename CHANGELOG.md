All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). We
consider it a breaking change when customer-facing APIs and contracts
change in a backwards-incompatible manner, e.g. our HTTP API or
our customer data transfer.

We do not consider it a breaking change with regard to the version number
of this repository when internal APIs change, e.g. customer YAML
configuration or the command line interface.
